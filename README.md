# Gemini-powered Image-based Chatbot

This chatbot is built using Google Gemini for the Large Language Model (LLM) and ChainLit for a user-friendly Streamlit interface. It enables users to upload images, ask questions about the images, and receive AI-generated answers based on the content of the image and the question. The system uses Google Gemini's `gemini-1.5-flash` model for generating responses.

## Features:
- Image Upload: Users can upload multiple images (up to 5) in various formats.
- AI-powered Questioning: Ask questions about uploaded images, and get relevant answers generated by Gemini.
- History Tracking: Keeps a history of questions and answers for each session.
- Simple and easy-to-use interface built on ChainLit and Streamlit.

## How to Use:
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up the `GEMINI_API_KEY` environment variable with your Google Gemini API key.
3. Install dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works:
1. Users upload images through the interface.
2. The chatbot processes the images and allows users to ask questions about them.
3. The system generates answers using the Google Gemini model and displays them along with the uploaded image.
